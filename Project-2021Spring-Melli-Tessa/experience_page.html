        <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
        Biotechnology Professional with over three (3) years’ industry experience in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Core
        areas of knowledge include Quality Control, Research, and Manufacturing Sciences and Technology (MS&T/MSAT).<br>
        Core competencies: cGMP, GDP, GLP, start-up activities, technology transfer, root-cause analysis, data trending,
        statistical data analysis, Design of Experiments (DOE), technical writing, aseptic gowning, Lean Principles <br><br>
        <b>EXPERIENCE</b><br>
        AveXis | Longmont, Colorado<br>
        Process Science Engineer II | Upstream Tech R&D Lab | September 2019 – Present<br>
        Summary: Execute experiments in support of adherent cell expansion and scale-down reactor models. Analyze data and
        draft technical reports to enable cross-network decisions on manufacturing process changes and troubleshooting.<br>
        o SME of analytical test equipment: understand operation and use, perform instrument maintenance and
        troubleshooting, train others on sample testing, and interface with vendors for instrument IQOQ and PM activities<br>
        o SME of adherent cell expansion: understand passaging technique across multiple adherent cell culture vessels, train
        individuals on passaging, revise procedures and data capture sheets, and design and implement a strategy to
        maintain a continuous rolling cell stock to enable inoculation of laboratory reactors per the schedule<br>
        o Design and organize the lab space, and continuously assess consumables required to perform laboratory operations<br><br>
        Quality Control Analyst | Analytical Microbiology | April 2019 – September 2019<br>
        Summary: Assisted in method transfer and process implementation in support of site start-up activities for QC.<br>
        o Contributed to start-up of the raw material sampling program, including transfer of SOPs, creation of a sampling
        forecast tool, and assessing operational requirements to avoid additional modifications to the original facility space
        o Worked with a multi-site team to achieve alignment in conductivity test practices, that were in compliance with
        compendial requirements, in order to successfully transfer the method to the site<br><br>
        AstraZeneca | Boulder, Colorado | January 2017 – March 2019<br>
        Quality Control Analyst | Microbiology<br>
        Summary: Supported routine and non-routine microbiological analyses and evaluated results against limits and
        specifications. Drafted, revised, and reviewed controlled documents such as protocols, reports, and SOPs.<br>
        o Contributed to site start-up activities in support of a PPQ campaign, including: Cleaning Validation, Performance
        Qualifications (Clean Utilities, EM, SIP), Process Characterization, and Process Validation<br>
        o Leveraged sample matrix information from manufacturing process documentation and MS&T SMEs to execute a
        strategy that reduced sample type qualification testing for two test methods by 60%<br>
        o Compiled data and performed statistical analysis for trending and alert/action limit assessments<br>
        o Created automated query tools to reduce time to perform sample forecasting and reconciliation by 75%<br><br>
        Bayer Healthcare | Berkeley, California | June 2015 - August 2015<br>
        Manufacturing Sciences Intern | Drug Product<br>
        Summary: Investigated the stability of a therapeutic protein under time/temperature stress and freeze-thaw conditions.<br><br>
        University of Colorado | Boulder, Colorado | August 2014 - May 2015<br>
        Undergraduate Researcher | Materials Science<br>
        Summary: Developed and optimized a thermally re-mendable polymeric material with structural integrity retention.<br><br>
